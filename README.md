# FrozenLake MDP Assignment

## Assignment Overview

This class assignment focuses on solving problems with limited state spaces through the lens of the FrozenLake Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem. It is designed to 
introduce and apply fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning, specifically Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms.

## Outline

- **Part 0: Introduction to Gym**
  - Get acquainted with `gym`, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. This part provides a practical environment to test and understand the
  - behavior of algorithms on various problems, including the FrozenLake MDP.
  
- **Q-Learning and SARSA Implementation**
  - Dive into the implementation of two key reinforcement learning algorithms: Q-Learning and SARSA. Learn how these algorithms enable an agent to navigate and make decisions
  - in an environment based on rewards and penalties.
  
- **Recall: FrozenLake-v1 Environment in Gym**
  - Explore the `FrozenLake-v1` environment within `gym`. This section is aimed at understanding the specifics of the FrozenLake problem, including its states, actions, and
  - rewards.
